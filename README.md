# hello-world
Hello everyone! This me, Austin, making my first repository 
I am excited to learn about coding and very nervous! I need a change and I have always loved computers 
I have a great support circle around me and I am eager to explore the world of tech :D

Shoutout to Josh who will help me along the way!
